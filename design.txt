I am creating a project for freshman at a community college.  The are freshman and are studying python. I want them to gain experience supporting a data science project.

The project should give them the types of analysis to do and they are to support it by reading documentation (provide the links to the docs).  Essentially, mimick a data scientist assigning programming to a jr. developer.

The will be given easy to understand tasks - fully realized, and links to documentation necessary to do the job.
